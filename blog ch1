Days With an Electric Car: My Journey with the MG ZS EV

It all started with a search for the perfect car to fit my requirements and budget. I had shortlisted three cars: the MG Hector 2022, the Mahindra XUV 700, and the Jeep Compass. Unfortunately, the Hector was only available in petrol with automatic transmission, and the Jeep was almost out of my budget. So, I decided to book the XUV700 and waited for eight long months, but to no avail.

That's when I turned my attention to electric cars. I took test drives of two models: the BYD e6 and the MG ZS EV 2021. The BYD was impressive in terms of its range and performance, but it lacked most of the premium features. On the other hand, I found the ZS EV to be a smooth and efficient ride, thanks to the instant torque delivered by its electric motor.

Electric cars are cost-effective to run and maintain, and I chose to buy one primarily for this reason. I wasn't particularly concerned about the environment-friendliness of electric cars, as I knew that the same coal was used to produce electricity in India. Moreover, I couldn't find any other car on the market that fit my requirements in terms of budget and waiting period.

So, I booked the MG ZS EV in February 2022 and waited until July to take delivery. The entire process was seamless, thanks to MG Kottayam.

The Initial Days With My EV

I decided to take my new car on a long journey, driving 1000 kilometers in just three days. It wasn't because I was particularly impressed with the car or its capabilities, but because I had to come back to my workplace in Chennai.

Starting a long journey with a brand new car was a challenge, and it turned into a nightmare when we faced a power cut in my hometown on the first night. We couldn't start the journey with a fully charged battery, which meant we had to stop and charge the car at a KSEB charger in Angamaly.

Thankfully, the charging experience was seamless. We used the app to reserve the charger and initiated the charging process while we had breakfast. Our next stop was a Zeon charger at A2B hotels in Walayar, where we encountered our first lesson. We saw another electric car on the road, a Tata Nexon. Most of the time, our car was in front of his, but when we were about to reach the charging station, he overtook us and drove very fast to reach the charger ahead of us. We learned that we would always be "nexxoned" in all fast DC chargers!

Our next planned charging station was near Salem, but we missed it somehow. We had to detour another 20 kilometers to reach a Zeon 50Kw charger in Rasipuram. Again, there was a Tata Nexon charging from 85% to 100%, and we couldn't locate the owner of the car. We had to wait for another 45 minutes, but then the power went off. We found a nearby Relux charger with 7.8 kW capacity on the Plugshare app, but it was a stranded location with no signboards or amenities nearby. When we tried to connect the charger with the app, it showed some errors, and the connector got stuck! It was a terrible experience, as we were in a deserted place with heavy rains and thunderstorms all around us. We called the customer care, and they helped us release the car from the charger connector.

We went back to the same charger in Rasipuram and waited for the power to come back on for another 45 minutes,Then charged till 90 % and left for Chennai. Meanwhile, our friend, who had started from our first charging location in his Scoda ICE car, had already reached Chennai while we were still searching and roaming around the suburbs of an unknown city with heavy rains! It was quite terrible for a first long trip.

Our rest of the trip to Chennai was eventless. We drove slowly as it was still raining heavily and charged one final time near Vikravandi using a Relux charger at Hotel Aiswarya International at midnight. The security was very gentle and helpful and assisted us in all ways he could.

Even though we spent more than 20 hours inside the car, we didn't experience any fatigue once we reached our home in Thiruvanmiyur by 5 AM the next day morning. In the end, it was a good learning experience for us, and we realized the importance of proper planning and research before embarking on long trips with an electric vehicle. Despite the initial difficulties, we were impressed with the charging infrastructure available and the support we received from charging station operators. We look forward to more exciting trips with our electric car in the future!
